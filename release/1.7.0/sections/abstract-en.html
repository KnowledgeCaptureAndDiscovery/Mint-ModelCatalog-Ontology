<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Software Description Ontology for Models (sdm) expands the [software description ontology](https://w3id.org/okn/o/sd#) (SD) to describe information about scientific software models. Examples of scientific software models are hydrology models, agriculture models or economy models that capture the equations needed to represent a problem. The software description ontology has been used to represent models as part of the [Model Integration framework](https://mint-project.info/), and examples of different models can be browsed [here](https://models.mint.isi.edu/)</span>
